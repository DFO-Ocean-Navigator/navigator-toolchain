4.13 'ncrename' netCDF Renamer
==============================

SYNTAX
     ncrename [-a OLD_NAME,NEW_NAME] [-a ...] [-D DBG]
     [-d OLD_NAME,NEW_NAME] [-d ...] [-g OLD_NAME,NEW_NAME] [-g ...]
     [--glb ...] [-h] [--hdf] [--hdr_pad NBR] [--hpss]
     [-l PATH] [-O] [-o OUTPUT-FILE] [-p PATH] [-R] [-r]
     [-v OLD_NAME,NEW_NAME] [-v ...]
     INPUT-FILE [[OUTPUT-FILE]]

DESCRIPTION

   'ncrename' renames netCDF dimensions, variables, attributes, and
groups.  Each object that has a name in the list of old names is renamed
using the corresponding name in the list of new names.  All the new
names must be unique.  Every old name must exist in the input file,
unless the old name is preceded by the period (or "dot") character '.'.
The validity of OLD_NAME is not checked prior to the renaming.  Thus, if
OLD_NAME is specified without the '.' prefix that indicates the presence
of OLD_NAME is optional, and OLD_NAME is not present in INPUT-FILE, then
'ncrename' will abort.  The NEW_NAME should never be prefixed by a '.'
(or else the period will be included as part of the new name).  As of
NCO version 4.4.6 (released October, 2014), the OLD_NAME and NEW_NAME
arguments may include (or be, for groups) partial or full group paths.
The OPTIONS and EXAMPLES show how to select specific variables whose
attributes are to be renamed.

   Caveat lector: Unforunately from 2007-present (November, 2019) the
netCDF library (versions 4.0.0-4.7.2) contains bugs or limitations that
sometimes prevent NCO from correctly renaming coordinate variables,
dimensions, and groups in netCDF4 files.  (To our knowledge the netCDF
library calls for renaming always work well on netCDF3 files so one
workaround to many netCDF4 issues is convert to netCDF3, rename, then
convert back).  To understand the renaming limitations associated with
particular netCDF versions, read the 'ncrename' documentation below in
its entirety.

   Although 'ncrename' supports full pathnames for both OLD_NAME and
NEW_NAME, this is really "window dressing".  The full-path to NEW_NAME
must be identical to the full-path to OLD_NAME in all classes of objects
(attributes, variables, dimensions, or groups).  In other words,
'ncrename' can change only the local names of objects, it cannot change
the location of the object in the group hierarchy within the file.
Hence using a full-path in NEW_NAME is redundant.  The object name is
the terminal path component of NEW_NAME and this object must already
exist in the group specified by the OLD_NAME path.

   'ncrename' is an exception to the normal NCO rule that the user will
be interactively prompted before an existing file is changed, and that a
temporary copy of an output file is constructed during the operation.
If only INPUT-FILE is specified, then 'ncrename' changes object names in
the INPUT-FILE in place without prompting and without creating a
temporary copy of 'input-file'.  This is because the renaming operation
is considered reversible if the user makes a mistake.  The NEW_NAME can
easily be changed back to OLD_NAME by using 'ncrename' one more time.

   Note that renaming a dimension to the name of a dependent variable
can be used to invert the relationship between an independent coordinate
variable and a dependent variable.  In this case, the named dependent
variable must be one-dimensional and should have no missing values.
Such a variable will become a coordinate variable.

   According to the 'netCDF User Guide', renaming objects in netCDF
files does not incur the penalty of recopying the entire file when the
NEW_NAME is shorter than the OLD_NAME.  Thus 'ncrename' may run much
faster (at least on netCDF3 files) if judicious use of header padding
(*note Metadata Optimization::) was made when producing the INPUT-FILE.
Similarly, using the '--hdr_pad' option with 'ncrename' helps ensure
that future metadata changes to OUTPUT-FILE occur as swifly as possible.

OPTIONS

'-a OLD_NAME,NEW_NAME'
     Attribute renaming.  The old and new names of the attribute are
     specified with '-a' (or '--attribute') by the associated OLD_NAME
     and NEW_NAME values.  Global attributes are treated no differently
     than variable attributes.  This option may be specified more than
     once.  As mentioned above, all occurrences of the attribute of a
     given name will be renamed unless the '.' form is used, with one
     exception.  To change the attribute name for a particular variable,
     specify the OLD_NAME in the format OLD_VAR_NAME@OLD_ATT_NAME.  The
     '@' symbol delimits the variable from the attribute name.  If the
     attribute is uniquely named (no other variables contain the
     attribute) then the OLD_VAR_NAME@OLD_ATT_NAME syntax is redundant.
     The OLD_VAR_NAME variable names 'global' and 'group' have special
     significance.  They indicate that OLD_ATT_NM should only be renamed
     where it occurs as a global (i.e., root group) metadata attribute
     (for 'global'), or (for 'group') as _any_ group attribute, and not
     where it occurs as a variable attribute.  The VAR_NAME@ATT_NAME
     syntax is accepted, though not required, for the NEW_NAME.

'-d OLD_NAME,NEW_NAME'
     Dimension renaming.  The old and new names of the dimension are
     specified with '-d' (or '--dmn', '--dimension') by the associated
     OLD_NAME and NEW_NAME values.  This option may be specified more
     than once.

'-g OLD_NAME,NEW_NAME'
     Group renaming.  The old and new names of the group are specified
     with '-g' (or '--grp', '--group') by the associated OLD_NAME and
     NEW_NAME values.  This option may be specified more than once.
     This functionality is only available in NCO version 4.3.7 (October,
     2013) or later, and only when built on netCDF library version
     4.3.1-rc1 (August, 2013) or later.

'-v OLD_NAME,NEW_NAME'
     Variable renaming.  The old and new names of the variable are
     specified with '-v' (or '--variable') by the associated OLD_NAME
     and NEW_NAME values.  This option may be specified more than once.

EXAMPLES

   Rename the variable 'p' to 'pressure' and 't' to 'temperature' in
netCDF 'in.nc'.  In this case 'p' must exist in the input file (or
'ncrename' will abort), but the presence of 't' is optional:
     ncrename -v p,pressure -v .t,temperature in.nc

   Rename the attribute 'long_name' to 'largo_nombre' in the variable
'u', and no other variables in netCDF 'in.nc'.
     ncrename -a u@long_name,largo_nombre in.nc

   Rename the group 'g8' to 'g20' in netCDF4 file 'in_grp.nc':
     ncrename -g g8,g20 in_grp.nc

   Rename the variable '/g1/lon' to 'longitude' in netCDF4 'in_grp.nc':
     ncrename -v /g1/lon,longitude in_grp.nc
     ncrename -v /g1/lon,/g1/longitude in_grp.nc # Alternate

   'ncrename' does not automatically attach dimensions to variables of
the same name.  This is done to make renaming an easy way to change
whether a variable is a coordinate.  If you want to rename a coordinate
variable so that it remains a coordinate variable, you must separately
rename both the dimension and the variable:
     ncrename -d lon,longitude -v lon,longitude in.nc
   Unfortunately, the netCDF4 library had a longstanding bug (all
versions until 4.3.1-rc5 released in December, 2013) that crashed NCO
when performing this operation.  Simultaneously renaming variables and
dimensions in netCDF4 files with earlier versions of netCDF is
impossible; it must instead be done in two separate 'ncrename'
invocations (e.g., first rename the variable, then rename the dimension)
to avoid triggering the libary bug.

   A related bug causes unintended side-effects with 'ncrename' also
built with all versions of the netCDF4 library until 4.3.1-rc5 released
in December, 2013): This bug caused renaming _either_ a dimension _or_
its associated coordinate variable (not both, which would fail as above)
in a netCDF4 file to inadvertently rename both:
     # Demonstrate bug in netCDF4/HDF5 library prior to netCDF-4.3.1-rc5
     ncks -O -h -m -M -4 -v lat_T42 ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc
     ncrename -O -v lat_T42,lat ~/foo.nc ~/foo2.nc # Also renames dimension
     ncrename -O -d lat_T42,lat ~/foo.nc ~/foo2.nc # Also renames variable
   To avoid this faulty behavior, either build NCO with netCDF version
4.3.1-rc5 or later, or convert the file to netCDF3 first, then rename as
intended, then convert back.  Unforunately while this bug and the
related coordinate renaming bug were fixed in 4.3.1-rc5 (released in
December, 2013), a new and related bug was discovered in October 2014.

   Another netCDF4 bug that causes unintended side-effects with
'ncrename' affects (at least) versions 4.3.1-4.3.2 and all snapshots of
the netCDF4 library until January, 2015.  This bug (fixed in 4.3.3 in
February, 2015) corrupts values or renamed netCDF4 coordinate variables
(i.e., variables with underlying dimensions of the same name) and other
(non-coordinate) variables that include an underlying dimension that was
renamed.  In other words, _renaming_ coordinate variables and dimensions
succeeds yet it corrupts the values contained by the affected array
variables.  This bug corrupts affected variables by replacing their
values with the default '_FillValue' for that variable's type:
     # Demonstrate bug in netCDF4 libraries prior to version 4.3.3
     ncks -O -4 -C -M -v lat ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/bug.nc
     ncrename -O -v lat,tal ~/bug.nc ~/foo.nc # Broken until netCDF-4.3.3
     ncrename -O -d lat,tal ~/bug.nc ~/foo.nc # Broken until netCDF-4.3.3
     ncrename -O -d lat,tal -v lat,tal ~/bug.nc ~/foo.nc # Broken too
     ncks ~/foo.nc
   To avoid this faulty behavior, either build NCO with netCDF version
4.3.3 or later, or convert the file to netCDF3 first, then rename as
intended, then convert back.  This bug does not affect renaming of
groups or of attributes.

   Yet another netCDF4 bug that causes unintended side-effects with
'ncrename' affects only snapshots from January-February, 2015, and
released version 4.3.3 (February, 2015).  It was fixed in (and was the
reason for releasing) netCDF version 4.3.3.1 (March, 2015).  This bug
causes renamed attributes of coordinate variables in netCDF4 to files to
disappear:
     # Demonstrate bug in netCDF4 library version 4.3.3
     ncrename -O -h -a /g1/lon@units,new_units ~/nco/data/in_grp.nc ~/foo.nc 
     ncks -v /g1/lon ~/foo.nc # Shows units and new_units are both gone

   Clearly, renaming dimensions in netCDF4 files is non-trivial.  The
penultimate chapter in this saga is a netCDF4 bug discovered in
September, 2015, and present in versions 4.3.3.1 (and possibly earlier
versions too) and later.  As of this writing (February, 2018), this bug
is still present in netCDF4 version 4.6.0.1-development.  This bug
causes 'ncrename' to create corrupted output files when attempting to
rename two or more dimensions simultaneously.  The workaround is to
rename the dimensions sequentially, in two separate 'ncrename' calls.
     # Demonstrate bug in netCDF4 library versions 4.3.3.1--4.6.1+
     ncrename -O -d lev,z -d lat,y -d lon,x ~/nco/data/in_grp.nc ~/foo.nc # Completes but file is unreadable
     ncks -v one ~/foo.nc # File is unreadable (multiple dimensions with same ID?)

   A new netCDF4 renaming bug was discovered in March, 2017.  It is
present in versions 4.4.1-4.6.0 (and possibly earlier versions).  This
bug was fixed in netCDF4 version 4.6.1 (Yay Ed!).  This bug caused
'ncrename' to fail to rename a variable when the result would become a
coordinate.
     # Demonstrate bug in netCDF4 library versions 4.4.1--4.6.0
     ncrename -O -v non_coord,coord ~/nco/data/in_grp.nc ~/foo.nc # Fails (HDF error)
   The fix is to upgrade to netCDF version 4.6.1.  The workaround is to
convert to netCDF3, then rename, then convert back to netCDF4.

   A potentially new netCDF4 bug was discovered in November, 2017 and is
now fixed.  It is present in versions 4.4.1.1-4.6.0 (and possibly
earlier versions too).  This bug causes 'ncrename' to fail to rename a
variable when the result would become a coordinate.  Oddly this issue
shows that simultaneously renaming a dimension and coordinate can
succeed (in contrast to a bug described above), and that separating that
into two steps can fail.
     # Demonstrate bug in netCDF4 library versions 4.4.1--4.6.0
     # 20171107: https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/597
     # Create test dataset
     ncks -O -C -v lon ~/nco/data/in_grp.nc ~/in_grp.nc
     ncks -O -x -g g1,g2 ~/in_grp.nc ~/in_grp.nc
     # Rename dimension then variable
     ncrename -d lon,longitude ~/in_grp.nc # works
     ncrename -v lon,longitude ~/in_grp.nc # borken "HDF error"
     # Rename variable then dimension
     ncrename -v lon,longitude ~/in_grp.nc # works
     ncrename -d lon,longitude ~/in_grp.nc # borken "nc4_reform_coord_var: Assertion `dim_datasetid > 0' failed."
     # Oddly renaming both simultaneously works:
     ncrename -d lon,longitude -v lon,longitude ~/in_grp.nc # works
   The fix is to upgrade to netCDF version 4.6.1.  The workaround is to
convert to netCDF3, then rename, then convert back to netCDF4.

   A new netCDF3 bug was discovered in April, 2018 and is now fixed.  It
is present in netCDF versions 4.4.1-4.6.0 (and possibly earlier versions
too).  This bug caused 'ncrename' to fail to rename many coordinates and
dimensions simultaneously.  This bug affects netCDF3 '64BIT_OFFSET'
files and possibly other formats as well.  As such it is the first and
so far only bug we have identified that affects netCDF3 files.
     cp /glade/scratch/gus/GFDL/exp/CM3_test/pp/0001/0001.land_month_crop.AllD.nc ~/correa_in.nc   
     ncrename -O -d grid_xt,lon -d grid_yt,lat -v grid_xt,lon -v grid_yt,lat \
              -v grid_xt_bnds,lon_bnds -v grid_yt_bnds,lat_bnds ~/correa_in.nc ~/correa_out.nc 
   The fix is to upgrade to netCDF version 4.6.1.

   Create netCDF 'out.nc' identical to 'in.nc' except the attribute
'_FillValue' is changed to 'missing_value', the attribute 'units' is
changed to 'CGS_units' (but only in those variables which possess it),
the attribute 'hieght' is changed to 'height' in the variable 'tpt', and
in the variable 'prs_sfc', if it exists.
     ncrename -a _FillValue,missing_value -a .units,CGS_units \
       -a tpt@hieght,height -a prs_sfc@.hieght,height in.nc out.nc 
   The presence and absence of the '.' and '@' features cause this
command to execute successfully only if a number of conditions are met.
All variables _must_ have a '_FillValue' attribute _and_ '_FillValue'
must also be a global attribute.  The 'units' attribute, on the other
hand, will be renamed to 'CGS_units' wherever it is found but need not
be present in the file at all (either as a global or a variable
attribute).  The variable 'tpt' must contain the 'hieght' attribute.
The variable 'prs_sfc' need not exist, and need not contain the 'hieght'
attribute.

   Rename the global or group attribute 'Convention' to 'Conventions'
     ncrename -a Convention,Conventions  in.nc # Variable and group atts.
     ncrename -a .Convention,Conventions in.nc # Variable and group atts.
     ncrename -a @Convention,Conventions  in.nc # Group atts. only
     ncrename -a @.Convention,Conventions in.nc # Group atts. only
     ncrename -a global@Convention,Conventions   in.nc # Group atts. only
     ncrename -a .global@.Convention,Conventions in.nc # Group atts. only
     ncrename -a global@Convention,Conventions   in.nc # Global atts. only
     ncrename -a .global@.Convention,Conventions in.nc # Global atts. only
   The examples without the '@' character attempt to change the
attribute name in both Global or Group and variable attributes.  The
examples with the '@' character attempt to change only global and group
'Convention' attributes, and leave unchanged any 'Convention' attributes
attached directly to variables.  Attributes prefixed with a period
('.Convention') need not be present.  Attributes not prefixed with a
period ('Convention') must be present.  Variables prefixed with a period
('.' or '.global') need not be present.  Variables not prefixed with a
period ('global') must be present.

DESCRIPTION

   'ncwa' performs statistics (including, but not limited to, averages)
on variables in a single file over arbitrary dimensions, with options to
specify weights, masks, and normalization.  *Note Statistics vs.
Concatenation::, for a description of the distinctions between the
various statistics tools and concatenators.  The default behavior of
'ncwa' is to arithmetically average every numerical variable over all
dimensions and to produce a scalar result for each.

   Averaged dimensions are, by default, eliminated as dimensions.  Their
corresponding coordinates, if any, are output as scalar variables.  The
'-b' switch (and its long option equivalents '--rdd' and
'--retain-degenerate-dimensions') causes 'ncwa' to retain averaged
dimensions as degenerate (size 1) dimensions.  This maintains the
association between a dimension (or coordinate) and variables after
averaging and simplifies, for instance, later concatenation along the
degenerate dimension.

   To average variables over only a subset of their dimensions, specify
these dimensions in a comma-separated list following '-a', e.g., '-a
time,lat,lon'.  As with all arithmetic operators, the operation may be
restricted to an arbitrary hyperslab by employing the '-d' option (*note
Hyperslabs::).  'ncwa' also handles values matching the variable's
'_FillValue' attribute correctly.  Moreover, 'ncwa' understands how to
manipulate user-specified weights, masks, and normalization options.
With these options, 'ncwa' can compute sophisticated averages (and
integrals) from the command line.

   MASK_VAR and WEIGHT, if specified, are broadcast to conform to the
variables being averaged.  The rank of variables is reduced by the
number of dimensions which they are averaged over.  Thus arrays which
are one dimensional in the INPUT-FILE and are averaged by 'ncwa' appear
in the OUTPUT-FILE as scalars.  This allows the user to infer which
dimensions may have been averaged.  Note that that it is impossible for
'ncwa' to make make a WEIGHT or MASK_VAR of rank W conform to a VAR of
rank V if W > V.  This situation often arises when coordinate variables
(which, by definition, are one dimensional) are weighted and averaged.
'ncwa' assumes you know this is impossible and so 'ncwa' does not
attempt to broadcast WEIGHT or MASK_VAR to conform to VAR in this case,
nor does 'ncwa' print a warning message telling you this, because it is
so common.  Specifying DBG > 2 does cause 'ncwa' to emit warnings in
these situations, however.

   Non-coordinate variables are always masked and weighted if specified.
Coordinate variables, however, may be treated specially.  By default, an
averaged coordinate variable, e.g., 'latitude', appears in OUTPUT-FILE
averaged the same way as any other variable containing an averaged
dimension.  In other words, by default 'ncwa' weights and masks
coordinate variables like all other variables.  This design decision was
intended to be helpful but for some applications it may be preferable
not to weight or mask coordinate variables just like all other
variables.  Consider the following arguments to 'ncwa': '-a latitude -w
lat_wgt -d latitude,0.,90.' where 'lat_wgt' is a weight in the
'latitude' dimension.  Since, by default 'ncwa' weights coordinate
variables, the value of 'latitude' in the OUTPUT-FILE depends on the
weights in LAT_WGT and is not likely to be 45.0, the midpoint latitude
of the hyperslab.  Option '-I' overrides this default behavior and
causes 'ncwa' not to weight or mask coordinate variables (1).  In the
above case, this causes the value of 'latitude' in the OUTPUT-FILE to
be 45.0, an appealing result.  Thus, '-I' specifies simple arithmetic
averages for the coordinate variables.  In the case of latitude, '-I'
specifies that you prefer to archive the arithmetic mean latitude of the
averaged hyperslabs rather than the area-weighted mean latitude.  (2).

   As explained in *Note Operation Types::, 'ncwa' _always averages_
coordinate variables regardless of the arithmetic operation type
performed on the non-coordinate variables.  This is independent of the
setting of the '-I' option.  The mathematical definition of operations
involving rank reduction is given above (*note Operation Types::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The default behavior of ('-I') changed on 19981201--before this
date the default was not to weight or mask coordinate variables.

   (2) If 'lat_wgt' contains Gaussian weights then the value of
'latitude' in the OUTPUT-FILE will be the area-weighted centroid of the
hyperslab.  For the example given, this is about 30 degrees.

4.14.1 Mask condition
---------------------

The mask condition has the syntax MASK_VAR MASK_COMP MASK_VAL.  The
preferred method to specify the mask condition is in one string with the
'-B' or '--mask_condition' switches.  The older method is to use the
three switches '-m', '-T', and '-M' to specify the MASK_VAR, MASK_COMP,
and MASK_VAL, respectively.  (1).  The MASK_CONDITION string is
automatically parsed into its three constituents MASK_VAR, MASK_COMP,
and MASK_VAL.

   Here MASK_VAR is the name of the masking variable (specified with
'-m', '--mask-variable', '--mask_variable', '--msk_nm', or '--msk_var').
The truth MASK_COMP argument (specified with '-T', '--mask_comparator',
'--msk_cmp_typ', or '--op_rlt' may be any one of the six arithmetic
comparators: 'eq', 'ne', 'gt', 'lt', 'ge', 'le'.  These are the
Fortran-style character abbreviations for the logical comparisons ==,
!=, >, <, >=, <=.  The mask comparator defaults to 'eq' (equality).  The
MASK_VAL argument to '-M' (or '--mask-value', or '--msk_val') is the
right hand side of the "mask condition".  Thus for the I'th element of
the hyperslab to be averaged, the mask condition is mask(i) MASK_COMP
MASK_VAL.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The three switches '-m', '-T', and '-M' are maintained for
backward compatibility and may be deprecated in the future.  It is
safest to write scripts using '--mask_condition'.


File: nco.info,  Node: Normalization and Integration,  Prev: Mask condition,  Up: ncwa netCDF Weighted Averager

4.14.2 Normalization and Integration
------------------------------------

'ncwa' has one switch which controls the normalization of the averages
appearing in the OUTPUT-FILE.  Short option '-N' (or long options
'--nmr' or '--numerator') prevents 'ncwa' from dividing the weighted sum
of the variable (the numerator in the averaging expression) by the
weighted sum of the weights (the denominator in the averaging
expression).  Thus '-N' tells 'ncwa' to return just the numerator of the
arithmetic expression defining the operation (*note Operation Types::).

   With this normalization option, 'ncwa' can integrate variables.
Averages are first computed as sums, and then normalized to obtain the
average.  The original sum (i.e., the numerator of the expression in
*note Operation Types::) is output if default normalization is turned
off (with '-N').  This sum is the integral (not the average) over the
specified (with '-a', or all, if none are specified) dimensions.  The
weighting variable, if specified (with '-w'), plays the role of the
differential increment and thus permits more sophisticated integrals
(i.e., weighted sums) to be output.  For example, consider the variable
'lev' where LEV = [100,500,1000] weighted by the weight 'lev_wgt' where
LEV_WGT = [10,2,1].  The vertical integral of 'lev', weighted by
'lev_wgt', is the dot product of LEV and LEV_WGT.  That this is
is 3000.0 can be seen by inspection and verified with the integration
command
     ncwa -N -a lev -v lev -w lev_wgt in.nc foo.nc;ncks foo.nc

EXAMPLES

   Given file '85_0112.nc':
     netcdf 85_0112 {
     dimensions:
             lat = 64 ;
             lev = 18 ;
             lon = 128 ;
             time = UNLIMITED ; // (12 currently)
     variables:
             float lat(lat) ;
             float lev(lev) ;
             float lon(lon) ;
             float time(time) ;
             float scalar_var ;
             float three_dmn_var(lat, lev, lon) ;
             float two_dmn_var(lat, lev) ;
             float mask(lat, lon) ;
             float gw(lat) ;
     } 

   Average all variables in 'in.nc' over all dimensions and store
results in 'out.nc':
     ncwa in.nc out.nc
All variables in 'in.nc' are reduced to scalars in 'out.nc' since 'ncwa'
averages over all dimensions unless otherwise specified (with '-a').

   Store the zonal (longitudinal) mean of 'in.nc' in 'out.nc':
     ncwa -a lon in.nc out1.nc
     ncwa -a lon -b in.nc out2.nc
The first command turns 'lon' into a scalar and the second retains 'lon'
as a degenerate dimension in all variables.
     % ncks --trd -C -H -v lon out1.nc
     lon = 135
     % ncks --trd -C -H -v lon out2.nc
     lon[0] = 135
   In either case the tally is simply the size of 'lon', i.e., 180 for
the '85_0112.nc' file described by the sample header above.

   Compute the meridional (latitudinal) mean, with values weighted by
the corresponding element of GW (1):
     ncwa -w gw -a lat in.nc out.nc
Here the tally is simply the size of 'lat', or 64.  The sum of the
Gaussian weights is 2.0.

   Compute the area mean over the tropical Pacific:
     ncwa -w gw -a lat,lon -d lat,-20.,20. -d lon,120.,270. in.nc out.nc
Here the tally is 64 times 128 = 8192.

   Compute the area-mean over the globe using only points for which ORO
< 0.5 (2):
     ncwa -B 'ORO < 0.5'      -w gw -a lat,lon in.nc out.nc
     ncwa -m ORO -M 0.5 -T lt -w gw -a lat,lon in.nc out.nc
It is considerably simpler to specify the complete MASK_COND with the
single string argument to '-B' than with the three separate switches
'-m', '-T', and '-M' (3).  If in doubt, enclose the MASK_COND within
quotes since some of the comparators have special meanings to the shell.

   Assuming 70% of the gridpoints are maritime, then here the tally is
0.70 times 8192 = 5734.

   Compute the global annual mean over the maritime tropical Pacific:
     ncwa -B 'ORO < 0.5'      -w gw -a lat,lon,time \
       -d lat,-20.0,20.0 -d lon,120.0,270.0 in.nc out.nc
     ncwa -m ORO -M 0.5 -T lt -w gw -a lat,lon,time \
       -d lat,-20.0,20.0 -d lon,120.0,270.0 in.nc out.nc
   Further examples will use the one-switch specification of MASK_COND.

   Determine the total area of the maritime tropical Pacific, assuming
the variable AREA contains the area of each gridcell
     ncwa -N -v area -B 'ORO < 0.5' -a lat,lon \
       -d lat,-20.0,20.0 -d lon,120.0,270.0 in.nc out.nc
   Weighting AREA (e.g., by GW) is not appropriate because AREA is
_already_ area-weighted by definition.  Thus the '-N' switch, or,
equivalently, the '-y ttl' switch, correctly integrate the cell areas
into a total regional area.

   Mask a file to contain _FILLVALUE everywhere except where THR_MIN <=
MSK_VAR <= THR_MAX:
     # Set masking variable and its scalar thresholds
     export msk_var='three_dmn_var_dbl' # Masking variable
     export thr_max='20' # Maximum allowed value
     export thr_min='10' # Minimum allowed value
     ncecat -O in.nc out.nc # Wrap out.nc in degenerate "record" dimension
     ncwa -O -a record -B "${msk_var} <= ${thr_max}" out.nc out.nc
     ncecat -O out.nc out.nc # Wrap out.nc in degenerate "record" dimension
     ncwa -O -a record -B "${msk_var} >= ${thr_min}" out.nc out.nc
   After the first use of 'ncwa', 'out.nc' contains _FILLVALUE where
'${msk_var} >= ${thr_max}'.  The process is then repeated on the
remaining data to filter out points where '${msk_var} <= ${thr_min}'.
The resulting 'out.nc' contains valid data only where THR_MIN <= MSK_VAR
<= THR_MAX.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) 'gw' stands for "Gaussian weight" in many climate models.

   (2) 'ORO' stands for "Orography" in some climate models and in those
models ORO < 0.5 selects ocean gridpoints.

   (3) Unfortunately the '-B' and '--mask_condition' options are
unsupported on Windows (with the MVS compiler), which lacks a free,
standard parser and lexer.

5.3 Proposals for Institutional Funding
=======================================

From 2004-2007, NSF funded a project (http://nco.sf.net#prp_sei) to
improve Distributed Data Reduction & Analysis (DDRA) by evolving NCO
parallelism (OpenMP, MPI) and Server-Side DDRA (SSDDRA) implemented
through extensions to OPeNDAP and netCDF4.  The SSDDRA features were
implemented in SWAMP, the PhD Thesis of Daniel Wang.  SWAMP dramatically
reduced bandwidth usage for NCO between client and server.

   With this first NCO proposal funded, the content of the next NCO
proposal became clear.  We had long been interested in obtaining NASA
support for HDF-specific enhancements to NCO.  From 2012-2015 the NASA
ACCESS program funded us to implement support support netCDF4 group
functionality.  Thus NCO will grow and evade bit-rot for the foreseeable
future.

   We are considering other interesting ideas for still more proposals.
Please contact us if you wish to be involved with any future NCO-related
proposals.  Comments on the proposals and letters of support are also
very welcome.

6 Quick Start
*************

Simple examples in Bash shell scripts showing how to average data with
different file structures.  Here we include monthly, seasonal and annual
average with daily or monthly data in either one file or multiple files.

* Menu:

* Daily data in one file::
* Monthly data in one file::
* One time point one file::
* Multiple files with multiple time points::


File: nco.info,  Node: Daily data in one file,  Next: Monthly data in one file,  Prev: Quick Start,  Up: Quick Start

6.1 Daily data in one file
==========================

Suppose we have daily data from Jan 1st, 1990 to Dec.  31, 2005 in the
file of 'in.nc' with the record dimension as 'time'.

*Monthly average:*
     for yyyy in {1990..2005}; do      # Loop over years
       for moy in {1..12}; do          # Loop over months
         mm=$( printf "%02d" ${moy} )  # Change to 2-digit format
     
         # Average specific month yyyy-mm
         ncra -O -d time,"${yyyy}-${mm}-01","${yyyy}-${mm}-31" \
              in.nc in_${yyyy}${mm}.nc
       done
     done
     
     # Concatenate monthly files together
     ncrcat -O in_??????.nc out.nc

*Annual average:*
     for yyyy in {1990..2005}; do      # Loop over years
       ncra -O -d time,"${yyyy}-01-01","${yyyy}-12-31" in.nc in_${yyyy}.nc
     done
     
     # Concatenate annual files together
     ncrcat -O in_????.nc out.nc
   The '-O' switch means to overwrite the pre-existing files (*note
Batch Mode::).  The '-d' option is to specify the range of hyperslabs
(*note Hyperslabs::).  There are detailed instructions on 'ncra' (*note
ncra netCDF Record Averager:: and 'ncrcat' (*note ncrcat netCDF Record
Concatenator::).  NCO supports UDUnits so that we can use readable dates
as time dimension (*note UDUnits Support::).


File: nco.info,  Node: Monthly data in one file,  Next: One time point one file,  Prev: Daily data in one file,  Up: Quick Start

6.2 Monthly data in one file
============================

Inside the input file 'in.nc', the record dimension 'time' is from Jan
1990 to Dec 2005.

*Seasonal average (e.g., DJF):*
     ncra -O --mro -d time,"1990-12-01",,12,3 in.nc out.nc

*Annual average:*
     ncra -O --mro -d time,,,12,12 in.nc out.nc
   Here we use the subcycle feature (i.e., the number after the fourth
comma: '3' in the seasonal example and the second '12' in the annual
example) to retrieve groups of records separated by regular intervals
(*note Subcycle::).  The option '--mro' switches 'ncra' to produce a
Multi-Record Output instead of a single-record output.  For example,
assume SND is a 3D array with dimensions 'time' * 'latitude' *
'longitude' and 'time' includes every month from Jan.  1990 to Dec.
2005, 192 months as total, which are 16 years.  Let's look at the
following two command lines.
     ncra --mro -v snd -d time,"1990-12-01",,12,3 in.nc out_mro.nc
     ncra -v snd -d time,"1990-12-01",,12,3 in.nc out_sro.nc
   In the first output file, 'out_mro.nc', SND is still a 3D array with
dimensions 'time' * 'latitude' * 'longitude', but the length of 'time'
now is 16, meaning 16 winters.  In the second output file, 'out_sro.nc',
the length of 'time' is only 1.  It is now the average of all the 16
winters.

   when using '-d DIM,min[,max]' to specify the hyperslabs, you can
leave it blank if you want to include the minimum or the maximum of the
data, like we did above.


File: nco.info,  Node: One time point one file,  Next: Multiple files with multiple time points,  Prev: Monthly data in one file,  Up: Quick Start

6.3 One time point one file
===========================

This means if you have daily data of 30 days, there will be 30 data
files.  Or if you have monthly data of 12 months, there will be 12 data
files.  Dealing with this kind of files, you need to specify the file
names in shell scripts and pass them to NCO operators.  For example,
your daily data files may look like 'snd_19900101.nc',
'snd_19900102.nc', 'snd_19900103.nc' ...  If you want to know the
monthly average of Jan 1990, you can write like,
     ncra -O snd_199001??.nc out.nc
   You might want to use loop if you need the average of each month.
     for moy in {1..12}; do          # Loop over months
       mm=$( printf "%02d" ${moy} )  # Change to 2-digit format
     
       ncra -O snd_????${mm}??.nc out_${mm}.nc
     done


File: nco.info,  Node: Multiple files with multiple time points,  Prev: One time point one file,  Up: Quick Start

6.4 Multiple files with multiple time points
============================================

Similar as the last one, it's more about shell scripts.  Suppose you
have daily data with one month of them in one data file.  The monthly
average is simply to apply 'ncra' on the specific data file.  And for
seasonal averages, you can specify the three months by shell scripts.

7 CMIP5 Example
***************

The fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5
(http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/index.html?submenuheader=0)) provides
a multi-model framework for comparing the mechanisms and responses of
climate models from around the world.  However, it is a tremendous
workload to retrieve a single climate statistic from all these models,
each of which includes several ensemble members.  Not only that, it is
too often a tedious process that impedes new research and hypothesis
testing.  Our NASA ACCESS 2011 project simplified and accelerated this
process.

   Traditional geoscience data analysis requires users to work with
numerous flat (data in one level or namespace) files.  In that paradigm
instruments or models produce, and then repositories archive and
distribute, and then researchers request and analyze, collections of
flat files.  NCO works well with that paradigm, yet it also embodies the
necessary algorithms to transition geoscience data analysis from relying
solely on traditional (or "flat") datasets to allowing newer
hierarchical (or "nested") datasets.

   Hierarchical datasets support and enable combining all datastreams
that meet user-specified criteria into a single or small number of files
that hold _all_ the science-relevant data.  NCO (and no other software
to our knowledge) exploits this capability now.  Data and metadata may
be aggregated into and analyzed in hierarchical structures.  We call the
resulting data storage, distribution, and analysis paradigm
Group-Oriented Data Analysis and Distribution (GODAD).  GODAD lets the
scientific question organize the data, not the _ad hoc_ granularity of
all relevant datasets.  This chapter illustrates GODAD techniques
applied to analysis of the CMIP5 dataset.

   To begin, we document below a prototypical example of CMIP5 analysis
and evaluation using traditional NCO commands on netCDF3-format model
and HDF-EOS format observational (NASA MODIS satellite instrument)
datasets.  These examples complement the NCO User Guide by detailing
in-depth data analysis in a frequently encountered "real world" context.
Graphical representations of the results (NCL scripts available upon
request) are provided to illustrate physical meaning of the analysis.
Since NCO can process hierarchical datasets, i.e., datasets stored with
netCDF4 groups, we present sample scripts illustrating group-based
processing as well.

7.1 Combine Files
=================

Sometimes, the data of one ensemble member will be stored in several
files to reduce single file size.  It is more convenient to concatenate
these files into a single timeseries, and the following script
illustrates how.  Key steps include:
  1. Obtain number and names (or partial names) of files in a directory
  2. Concatenate files along the record dimension (usually time) using
     'ncrcat' (*note ncrcat netCDF Record Concatenator::).
     #!/bin/bash      # shell type
     shopt -s extglob # enable extended globbing
     
     #===========================================================================
     # Some of the models cut one ensemble member into several files, 
     #  which include data of different time periods.
     # We'd better concatenate them into one at the beginning so that 
     #  we won't have to think about which files we need if we want 
     #  to retrieve a specific time period later.
     #
     # Method:
     #	- Make sure 'time' is the record dimension (i.e., left-most)
     #	- ncrcat
     #
     # Input files like:
     # /data/cmip5/snc_LImon_bcc-csm1-1_historical_r1i1p1_185001-190012.nc

   CMIP5 model data downloaded from the Earth System Grid Federation
(ESGF (http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/)) does not contain group
features yet.  Therefore users must aggregate flat files into
hierarchical ones themselves.  The following script shows how.  Each
dataset becomes a group in the output file.  There can be several levels
of groups.  In this example, we employ two experiments ("scenarios") as
the top-level.  The second-level comprises different models (e.g.,
CCSM4, CESM1-BGC).  Many models are run multiple times with slight
perturbed initial conditions to produce an ensemble of realizations.
These ensemble members comprise the third level of the hierarchy.  The
script selects two variables, SNC and SND (snow cover and snow depth).

7.2 Global Distribution of Long-term Average
============================================

 [image src="xmp/fgr1.png" text="Global Distribution of Long-term Average." ]

Figure 7.1: Global Distribution of Long-term Average.
This section illustrates how to calculate the global distribution of
long-term average (*note Figure 7.1: fgr:glb.) with either flat files or
group file (http://nco.sourceforge.net/nco.html#index-groups).  Key
steps include:
  1. Average ensemble members of each model using 'nces' (*note nces
     netCDF Ensemble Statistics::)
  2. Average the record dimension using 'ncra' (*note ncra netCDF Record
     Averager::)
  3. Store results of each model as a distinct group in a single output
     file using 'ncecat' (*note ncrcat netCDF Record Concatenator::)
     with the '--gag' option
   The first example shows how to process flat files.

   The input file, 'sn_LImon_all-mdl_all-xpt_all-nsm_200001-200512.nc',
produced by 'cmb_fl_grp.sh', includes all the ensemble members as
groups.  The option '--nsm_grp' denotes that we are using group
ensembles mode (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nsm_grp) of 'nces', instead
of file ensembles mode (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nsm_fl), '--nsm_fl'.
The option '--nsm_sfx='_avg'' instructs 'nces' to store the output as a
new child group '/[model]/[model name]_avg/var'; otherwise, the output
will be stored directly in the parent group '/[model]/var'.  In the
final output file, 'sn_LImon_all-mdl_all-xpt_nsm-avg_tm-avg.nc',
sub-groups with a suffix of 'avg' are the long-term averages of each
model.  One thing to notice is that for now, ensembles with only one
ensemble member will be left untouched.

7.3 Annual Average over Regions
===============================

 [image src="xmp/fgr2.png" text="Annual Average over Regions." ]

Figure 7.2: Annual Average over Regions.
This section illustrates how to calculate the annual average over
specific regions (*note Figure 7.2: fgr:anl.).  Key steps include:
  1. Spatial average using 'ncap2' (*note ncap2 netCDF Arithmetic
     Processor::) and 'ncwa' (*note ncwa netCDF Weighted Averager::);
  2. Change dimension order using 'ncpdq' (*note ncpdq netCDF Permute
     Dimensions Quickly::);
  3. Annual average using 'ncra' (*note ncra netCDF Record Averager::);
  4. Anomaly from long-term average using 'ncbo' (*note ncbo netCDF
     Binary Operator::);
  5. Standard deviation using 'ncbo' (*note ncbo netCDF Binary
     Operator::) and 'nces' (*note nces netCDF Ensemble Statistics::);
  6. Rename variables using 'ncrename' (*note ncrename netCDF
     Renamer::);
  7. Edit attributions using 'ncatted' (*note ncatted netCDF Attribute
     Editor::);
  8. Linear regression using 'ncap2' (*note ncap2 netCDF Arithmetic
     Processor::);
  9. Use 'ncap2' (*note ncap2 netCDF Arithmetic Processor::) with nco
     script file (i.e., '.nco' file);
  10. Move variables around using 'ncks' (*note ncks netCDF Kitchen
     Sink::).

   With the <group> feature, all the loops over experiments, models and
ensemble members can be omitted.  As we are working on implementing
<group> feature in all NCO operators, some functions (e.g., regression
and standard deviation over ensemble members) may have to wait until the
new versions.

7.4 Monthly Cycle
=================

 [image src="xmp/fgr3.png" text="Monthly Cycle." ]

Figure 7.3: Monthly Cycle.
This script illustrates how to calculate the monthly anomaly from the
annual average (*note Figure 7.3: fgr:mon.).  In order to keep only the
monthly cycle, we will subtract the annual average of each year from the
monthly data, instead of subtracting the long-term average.  This is a
little more complicated in coding since we need to loop over years.

7.5 Regrid MODIS Data
=====================

In order to compare the results between MODIS and CMIP5 models, one
usually regrids one or both datasets so that the spatial resolutions
match.  Here, the script illustrates how to regrid MODIS data.  Key
steps include:
  1. Regrid using bilinear interpolation (*note Bilinear
     interpolation::)
  2. Rename variables, dimensions and attributions using 'ncrename'
     (*note ncrename netCDF Renamer::).
   *Main Script*

     # include bi_interp.nco
     
     #===========================================================================
     # Example for
     #	- regrid (using bi_interp.nco): the spatial resolution of MODIS data 
     #		is much finer than those of CMIP5 models. In order to compare
     #		the two, we can regrid MODIS data to comform to CMIP5.

7.7 Permute MODIS Coordinates
=============================

MODIS orders latitude data from 90°N to -90°N, and longitude from -180°E
to 180°E. However, CMIP5 orders latitude from -90°N to 90°N, and
longitude from 0°E to 360°E. This script changes the MODIS coordinates
to follow the CMIP5 convention.
     #!/bin/bash
     
     ##===========================================================================
     ## Example for
     ##	- permute coordinates: the grid of MODIS is 
     ##		from (-180 degE, 90 degN), the left-up corner, to
     ##		(180 degE, -90 degN), the right-low corner. However, CMIP5 is
     ##		from (0 degE, -90 degN) to (360 degE, 90 degN). The script
     ##		here changes the MODIS grid to CMIP5 grid.
     ##

This chapter illustrates how to use NCO to process and analyze the
results of a CCSM climate simulation.
     ************************************************************************
     Task 0: Finding input files
     x************************************************************************
     The CCSM model outputs files to a local directory like:
     
     /ptmp/zender/archive/T42x1_40
     
     Each component model has its own subdirectory, e.g., 
     
     /ptmp/zender/archive/T42x1_40/atm
     /ptmp/zender/archive/T42x1_40/cpl
     /ptmp/zender/archive/T42x1_40/ice
     /ptmp/zender/archive/T42x1_40/lnd
     /ptmp/zender/archive/T42x1_40/ocn
     
     within which model output is tagged with the particular model name
     
     /ptmp/zender/archive/T42x1_40/atm/T42x1_40.cam2.h0.0001-01.nc
     /ptmp/zender/archive/T42x1_40/atm/T42x1_40.cam2.h0.0001-02.nc

     ************************************************************************
     Task 1: Regional processing
     ************************************************************************
     The first task in data processing is often creating seasonal cycles.
     Imagine a 100-year simulation with its 1200 monthly mean files.
     Our goal is to create a single file containing 12 months of data.
     Each month in the output file is the mean of 100 input files.
     
     Normally, we store the "reduced" data in a smaller, local directory.
     
     caseid='T42x1_40'
     #drc_in="${DATA}/archive/${caseid}/atm"
     drc_in="${DATA}/${caseid}"
     drc_out="${DATA}/${caseid}"
     mkdir -p ${drc_out}
     cd ${drc_out}
     
     Method 1: Assume all data in directory applies
     for mth in {1..12}; do
       mm=`printf "%02d" $mth`
       ncra -O -D 1 -o ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm${mm}.nc \
         ${drc_in}/${caseid}.cam2.h0.*-${mm}.nc 
     done # end loop over mth
     
     Method 2: Use shell 'globbing' to construct input filenames
     for mth in {1..12}; do
       mm=`printf "%02d" $mth`
       ncra -O -D 1 -o ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm${mm}.nc \
         ${drc_in}/${caseid}.cam2.h0.00??-${mm}.nc \
         ${drc_in}/${caseid}.cam2.h0.0100-${mm}.nc
     done # end loop over mth
     
     Method 3: Construct input filename list explicitly
     for mth in {1..12}; do
       mm=`printf "%02d" $mth`
       fl_lst_in=''
       for yr in {1..100}; do
         yyyy=`printf "%04d" $yr`
         fl_in=${caseid}.cam2.h0.${yyyy}-${mm}.nc
         fl_lst_in="${fl_lst_in} ${caseid}.cam2.h0.${yyyy}-${mm}.nc"
       done # end loop over yr
       ncra -O -D 1 -o ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm${mm}.nc -p ${drc_in} \

     Make sure the output file averages correct input files!
     ncks --trd -M prints global metadata: 
     
       ncks --trd -M ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm01.nc
     
     The input files ncra used to create the climatological monthly mean
     will appear in the global attribute named 'history'.
     
     Use ncrcat to aggregate the climatological monthly means
     
       ncrcat -O -D 1 \
         ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm??.nc ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112.nc
     
     Finally, create climatological means for reference.
     The climatological time-mean:
     
       ncra -O -D 1 \
         ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112.nc ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm.nc
     
     The climatological zonal-mean:
     
       ncwa -O -D 1 -a lon \
         ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm.nc ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_x.nc
     
     The climatological time- and spatial-mean:
     
       ncwa -O -D 1 -a lon,lat,time -w gw \
         ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm.nc ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_xyt.nc
     
     This file contains only scalars, e.g., "global mean temperature",
     used for summarizing global results of a climate experiment.
     
     Climatological monthly anomalies = Annual Cycle: 
     Subtract climatological mean from climatological monthly means. 
     Result is annual cycle, i.e., climate-mean has been removed.
     
       ncbo -O -D 1 -o ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112_anm.nc \
         ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112.nc ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_xyt.nc
     
     ************************************************************************
     Task 2: Correcting monthly averages
     ************************************************************************
     The previous step appoximates all months as being equal, so, e.g.,
     February weighs slightly too much in the climatological mean.
     This approximation can be removed by weighting months appropriately.
     We must add the number of days per month to the monthly mean files.
     First, create a shell variable dpm:
     
     unset dpm # Days per month
     declare -a dpm
     dpm=(0 31 28.25 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31) # Allows 1-based indexing
     
     Method 1: Create dpm directly in climatological monthly means
     for mth in {1..12}; do
       mm=`printf "%02d" ${mth}`
       ncap2 -O -s "dpm=0.0*date+${dpm[${mth}]}" \
         ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm${mm}.nc ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm${mm}.nc
     done # end loop over mth
     
     Method 2: Create dpm by aggregating small files
     for mth in {1..12}; do
       mm=`printf "%02d" ${mth}`
       ncap2 -O -v -s "dpm=${dpm[${mth}]}" ~/nco/data/in.nc \
         ${drc_out}/foo_${mm}.nc
     done # end loop over mth
     ncecat -O -D 1 -p ${drc_out} -n 12,2,2 foo_${mm}.nc foo.nc
     ncrename -O -D 1 -d record,time ${drc_out}/foo.nc
     ncatted -O -h \
       -a long_name,dpm,o,c,"Days per month" \
       -a units,dpm,o,c,"days" \
       ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112.nc
     ncks -A -v dpm ${drc_out}/foo.nc ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112.nc
     
     Method 3: Create small netCDF file using ncgen
     cat > foo.cdl << 'EOF'
     netcdf foo { 
     dimensions:
     	time=unlimited;
     variables:
     	float dpm(time);
     	dpm:long_name="Days per month";
     	dpm:units="days";
     data:
     	dpm=31,28.25,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31;
     }
     EOF
     ncgen -b -o foo.nc foo.cdl
     ncks -A -v dpm ${drc_out}/foo.nc ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112.nc
     
     Another way to get correct monthly weighting is to average daily
     output files, if available.  
     
     ************************************************************************
     Task 3: Regional processing
     ************************************************************************
     Let's say you are interested in examining the California region.
     Hyperslab your dataset to isolate the appropriate latitude/longitudes.
     
     ncks -O -D 1 -d lat,30.0,37.0 -d lon,240.0,270.0 \ 
         ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112.nc \
         ${drc_out}/${caseid}_clm_0112_Cal.nc
     
     The dataset is now much smaller!
     To examine particular metrics.
